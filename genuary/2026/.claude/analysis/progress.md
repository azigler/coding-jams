### 2026-01-27 — First Implementation Session (Curator Agent)

**Beads worked**: mu-mdk, mu-q5p, mu-m8w, mu-tp4, mu-yal, mu-310 (all closed)

**Accomplished**:
- Created `src/museum/` directory structure:
  - `index.ts` — Museum entry point with lifecycle management
  - `scene.ts` — Three.js scene with camera, lights, floor, entrance zone
  - `navigation.ts` — WASD + mouse look navigation system
  - `zones/entrance.ts` — Day 17 hallway adapted as museum entrance
  - `zones/`, `exhibits/`, `utils/` directories for future work
- Added `#museum` route to harness navigation system:
  - Updated `harness/navigation.ts` with museum detection and loading
  - Updated `index.ts` with Museum button and dropdown option
  - Dynamic import of museum module to avoid circular deps
- Implemented entrance zone (adapted from Day 17 STARE):
  - p4m wallpaper pattern generation with 4-fold rotational symmetry
  - Wall sconces with warm flickering point lights
  - Doorway leading to main gallery area
  - Dark twilight atmosphere with fog
  - Shadow mapping enabled
- Implemented navigation:
  - WASD movement with arrow key support
  - Click-and-drag mouse look
  - Smooth velocity damping
  - Fixed camera height at 1.6m (human eye level)
- Exposed debug API:
  - `window.museumSetCamera(x, y, z)` for positioning
  - `window.museumGetFPS()` for performance monitoring

**Tested**:
- TypeScript compilation passes (no errors)
- Dev server starts successfully
- Route navigation between days and museum works

**Blockers**: None

**Next session**:
- Test the museum visually in a browser
- Implement collision detection for walls
- Build main gallery space with high ceiling
- Add exhibit frame system for rendering day canvases
