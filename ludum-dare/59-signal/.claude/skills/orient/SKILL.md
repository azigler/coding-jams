description: Session entrypoint -- discover state, classify work, route to sub-skill
---

# Orient

Entry point for every session. Discovers current state dynamically, classifies
remaining work by skill domain, and routes to the appropriate sub-skill.

**No hardcoded references.** Everything is discovered fresh from live state.

## Step 1: Read Foundation

Read these in order (stop and absorb each before continuing):

1. `CLAUDE.md` -- project definition, file layout, conventions
2. `MEMORY.md` -- user preferences, operational lessons (if exists)
3. All skill files in `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` -- understand available workflows

## Step 2: Discover Live State

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -5         # current version
git log --oneline -5                        # recent work
git branch -a | grep -v worktree            # active branches
br list                                     # open beads
git status --short                          # dirty files
```

From this, determine:
- **Version**: latest tag (e.g., v0.2.3)
- **Active branch**: any version branch means work in flight
- **Open beads**: any in-progress beads mean interrupted work
- **Dirty files**: uncommitted changes need attention first

## Step 3: Find Current Position

Locate the project's roadmap or plan files. Common locations:
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` or `refs/plans/` or `TODO.md`
- Design decision docs or ADRs

Walk the plan steps. Find the first incomplete item -- that's where we are.
If there are active plan files, read them for phase breakdown and specific tasks.

## Step 4: Classify Work by Skill Domain

Every task falls into exactly one domain. The pipeline is strictly ordered:

```
spec -> review -> test -> impl -> branch
        ^                         |
        +-- (new OQs discovered) -+
```

| Domain | Skill | When |
|--------|-------|------|
| **Spec** | `/spec` | Writing or amending a specification |
| **Review** | `/review` | Deciding open questions, resolving conflicts |
| **Test** | `/test` | Writing tests before implementation (TDD) |
| **Impl** | `/impl` | Building code until tests pass |
| **Branch** | `/branch` | Creating branches, merging, tagging releases |
| **Release** | `/release` | Cutting a tagged release |

## Step 5: Check Blockers

Before routing, verify:

1. **Open P1 questions** affecting target work? -> Route to `/review` first
2. **Prior branch not merged?** -> Can't start dependent work
3. **Dirty git state?** -> Clean up first
4. **Beads from interrupted session?** -> Assess whether to resume or close

If blockers exist, present them and ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 6: Present and Route

Show the user:

```
## Orientation Report

**Version**: vN.M.R
**Position**: [description of where we are in the plan]
**Active plan**: [plan file path, if any]
**Phase**: [which phase is current]
**Skill domain**: [spec / review / test / impl / branch / release]
**Blockers**: [none / list]

**Recommended action**: [what to do next]
```

Then invoke the appropriate skill.

## Post-Compaction Recovery

If you're resuming after context compaction:

1. **Do NOT immediately create branches or beads.** Orient first.
2. **Read the active plan file** if one exists. It has the phase breakdown.
3. **Check what's already done** by comparing the plan against git history and
   live state. Don't redo completed work.
4. **Present your findings** before taking any action. The user may have context
   you don't.

The most common post-compaction mistake is jumping straight to `/impl` when the
current phase actually needs `/spec` or `/review`. Always classify the work first.
